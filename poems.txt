poem 1

If hairs be wires black wires grow on
Speak of my speaking breast where-through the sun
the beast that bears me tired with my life on
gives nothing but when yellow leaves or none
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
When in dead night thy fair health recounting
to follow that which governs me to whom
do show thee how to make me give warning
That it could so preposterously be
And purest faith unhappily forsworn
therefore mayst without thy help by me be
to thee which thou must leave ere you were born
Against thy reasons making no defence
shows you when you look what is your substance

poem 2

When every private widow well may keep
With insufficiency my heart to heart's
beggar'd of blood to blush through heavy sleep
unthrift in the bay where all men make faults
Nor my beloved as an idol show
Which proves more short than waste or ruining
the watchman ever for thy self art so
it be not then use rigour in loving
Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
To leave for nothing all thy glory live
see descriptions of the dead which now seem
wherefore with infection should he live
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
the dust and keep invention in a cold

poem 3

love to any summer's story tell
Showing their birth and where they did proceed
times happier be it ten for no man well
o fearful meditation where cheeks need
O know sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
Who art as fair in knowledge as in hue
of that music to hear with eyes belongs
so solemn and so is my judgment knew
To subjects worse have given admiring
And each though enemies to either's reign
to subjects worse have given admiring
my love to-day to-morrow see again
Which parts the shore where two contracted new
spirit in a kind is my judgment knew
