Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's sizeBut when I start to tell them,They think I'm telling lies.I say,It's in the reach of my armsThe span of my hips,The stride of my step,The curl of my lips.I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.I walk into a roomJust as cool as you please,And to a man,The fellows stand orFall down on their knees.Then they swarm around me,A hive of honey bees.I say,It's the fire in my eyes,And the flash of my teeth,The swing in my waist,And the joy in my feet.I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.Men themselves have wonderedWhat they see in me.They try so muchBut they can't touchMy inner mystery.When I try to show themThey say they still can't see.I say,It's in the arch of my back,The sun of my smile,The ride of my breasts,The grace of my style.I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.Now you understandJust why my head's not bowed.I don't shout or jump aboutOr have to talk real loud.When you see me passingIt ought to make you proud.I say,It's in the click of my heels,The bend of my hair,the palm of my hand,The need of my care,'Cause I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.

If you can keep your head when all about you  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  But make allowance for their doubting too:If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,Or being hated don't give way to hating,  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;  If you can dream- -and not make dreams your master;   If you can think- -and not make thoughts your aim,If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  And treat those two impostors just the same:.If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;  If you can make one heap of all your winnings  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,And lose, and start again at your beginnings,  And never breathe a word about your loss:If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  To serve your turn long after they are gone,And so hold on when there is nothing in you  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on! ' If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  Or walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch,If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  If all men count with you, but none too much:If you can fill the unforgiving minute  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,  And- -which is more- -you'll be a Man, my son!

Are people born to love joy only to find out much later in life they forgot to keep the feeling of joy alive when they needed it the most as if people believe they don't deserve to feel joy when their life is almost over?  God our creator has another idea though.  When people reach the critical age of dwindling youthfulness, that's when people should not feel sorrowful that they have lost the joy of life they once enjoyed.  Instead, people should be preparing themselves for the promise of a heavenly eternity of the afterlife they are about to experience, and until that experience has actually happened people are to welcome it with as much joy as God had creating people in the first place.  So as a thank you to God our creator, the reward of people's joyful living ought to be given back to God with MORE passion than the joy people lived with here on Earth.People are born to live life to the fullest extent of joy possible.That is why life is such an amazing gift because children rarelyHave to be taught how to thoroughly enjoy their lives.Joyfulness is so naturally soothing to those people who seem to dread aging so as people age early in life, most everyone enjoys their incredibly energetic youthfulness to such a highly fulfilling degree of peace and gratitude aging is never a burdensome issue like it is later in life when all the joy a person has experienced seems to require some sort of replacement for the reality of a person's agingProblems the person can't seem to slow down or reverse anymore with aProper diet, medicine, and as much exercise as the body can handle.Isn't it ironically fascinating how some bodies can age slowly while other bodies age much faster than they should?  With that in mind, shouldn't a person's joyfulness to live be just as permanently experienced as aging always is to allow at least the faith believing possibility that joy should endure throughout ALL the person's life regardless of how much more life the person has been allowed to live? For those people who believe in God as wholeheartedly as they claim toBelieve and live by those valuable standards of a redeeming salvationIn an eternity of PURE joyfulness with more peace than Godly peopleWill ever be able to experience in their lives on Earth, the joy of living should never leave a person's mind or heart.  In my humble opinion, God intended life to be lived like this:  highly energetic early in life to help ensure joy of the maximum satisfaction of the youthfulness for exercising the body to the most potential gratitude for a person's healthy life regardless of how great the person's health really is, so that the only true feeling the person wantsAnd needs to feel is joy when the body no longer physically agrees to prolong the feeling of joy for the person to enjoy a longer life.

I love to rise in a summer mornWhen the birds sing on every tree; The distant huntsman winds his horn,And the skylark sings with me.O! what sweet company! But to go to school on a summer morn,O! it drives all joy away; Under a cruel eye outworn,The little ones spend the dayIn sighing and dismay.Ah! then at times I drooping sit,And spend many an anxious hour,Nor in my book can I take delight,Nor sit in learning's bower,Worn thro' with the dreary shower.How can the bird that is born for joySit in a cage and sing? How can a child, when fears annoy,But droop his tender wing,And forget his youthful spring? O! father and mother, if buds are nippedAnd blossoms blown away,And if the tender plants are strippedOf their joy in the springing day,By sorrow and care's dismay,How shall the summer arise in joy,Or the summer's fruits appear? Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,Or bless the mellowing year,When the blasts of winter appear?

The tempest calmed after bending the branches of the trees and leaning heavily upon the grain in the field. The stars appeared as broken remnants of lightning, but now silence prevailed over all, as if Nature's war had never been fought. At that hour a young woman entered her chamber and knelt by her bed sobbing bitterly. Her heart flamed with agony but she could finally open her lips and say, 'Oh Lord, bring him home safely to me. I have exhausted my tears and can offer no more, oh Lord, full of love and mercy. My patience is drained and calamity is seeking possession of my heart. Save him, oh Lord, from the iron paws of War; deliver him from such unmerciful Death, for he is weak, governed by the strong. Oh Lord, save my beloved, who is Thine own son, from the foe, who is Thy foe. Keep him from the forced pathway to Death's door; let him see me, or come and take me to him.' Quietly a young man entered. His head was wrapped in bandage soaked with escaping life. He approached he with a greeting of tears and laughter, then took her hand and placed against it his flaming lips. And with a voice with bespoke past sorrow, and joy of union, and uncertainty of her reaction, he said, 'Fear me not, for I am the object of your plea. Be glad, for Peace has carried me back safely to you, and humanity has restored what greed essayed to take from us. Be not sad, but smile, my beloved. Do not express bewilderment, for Love has power that dispels Death; charm that conquers the enemy. I am your one. Think me not a specter emerging from the House of Death to visit your Home of Beauty. 'Do not be frightened, for I am now Truth, spared from swords and fire to reveal to the people the triumph of Love over War. I am Word uttering introduction to the play of happiness and peace.' Then the young man became speechless and his tears spoke the language of the heart; and the angels of Joy hovered about that dwelling, and the two hearts restored the singleness which had been taken from them. At dawn the two stood in the middle of the field contemplating the beauty of Nature injured by the tempest. After a deep and comforting silence, the soldier said to his sweetheart, 'Look at the Darkness, giving birth to the Sun.'

A Christmas Prayer for YouBy Rebecca Barlow Jordan on Dec 20,2018 08: 30 amAs Christmas draws near, may our hearts also draw closer to the One we celebrate-it's all about Jesus. And despite the fears, the tears, and the challenges that invade our world daily, we can experience the joy and peace He came to bring. That's my wish for you this year, that not only will Jesus be the center of your Christmas celebration, but that you will know His joy and His peace, this Christmas, and always! A Christmas Prayer for You - Peace, joy, good will- if you're craving those things to be a reality in your life this year at Christmas, here's a Christmas prayer for you.My Christmas Prayer for YouI hope you'll read this Christmas prayer I wrote and accept it as my prayer-wish for each of you this Christmas. Take time this year to make prayer a part of your Christmas traditions, wherever you are.Over two thousand years ago a band of shepherds heard some startling news from angelic visitors: "Be not afraid; " "good news of great joy; " "peace on earth and good will." Seriously? But that was then, and now is now. Is that joy and peace still available? If you're craving those things for your life this year, no matter where you are, here's a prayer for peace and joy to be a reality in your life this year at Christmas: Lord, in a season when every heart should be happy and light, many of us are struggling with the heaviness of life—burdens that steal the joy right out of our Christmas stockings. Crazy weather disasters strike at unsuspecting areas, ravaging peaceful homes and interrupting the lives of unsuspecting residents. Tragedy arrives as innocent victims suffer, and an inner voice whispers, "Be afraid! " We need your peace, Jesus.Lord, we still carol the wonderful message, huddled beneath winter caps on snow-covered porches, or from churches, led by enthusiastic musicians or choir members. Yet we confess that our hearts are too often filled with wonder of a different kind: wondering when the bills will be paid, when the terror will stop, when rest will come. Will it ever? Is the message still true? In a world where worry, not peace, prevails, stir up that good news again. This Christmas, make it real in our hearts. Never have we needed Your joy and peace more than now.Thank You for the gift of Jesus, our Immanuel, the Word made flesh. Forgive us for forgetting—that Your love never changes, never fades, and that You never abandon the purpose for which You came: to save us from our sinful condition, and to give us life eternal, the joy of relationship with a holy God. Your birth—and Your death—sealed Your promise to us forever.For those whose hearts are battered by sorrow or broken relationships, for those whose lives know only conflict and confusion, for those whose bodies are tired and tested beyond their ability to endure this year—precious Savior, draw them close to You. Let them know You are still the same Jesus who was born of a virgin, not in a hospital but an animal barn, laid in a manger of hay. You are still the One sent by a heavenly Father who offered not condemnation for our sins, but love and forgiveness—and daily, divine fellowship.We not only need Your peace and joy; Lord, we crave it. You've promised rest for the weary, victory for the battle-scarred, peace for the anxious, and acceptance for the brokenhearted—not just at Christmas, but every day of every year. Release the joy in us that's been crushed by pride, wrong priorities, or world events. Tear down the strongholds that have held us captive far too long. Extinguish the flames of apprehension that rob us of a calm, quiet spirit. Show us again the beauty of that holy night so many centuries ago.Your name is still called "Wonderful, " "Counselor, " "The Mighty God, " "The Everlasting Father, " and "The Prince of Peace." As Your children, we cry out for a fresh filling, and a new awareness of Who You are. We choose by faith to make the "good news of great joy" a reality in our own lives, so others can see us as lighted trees of life, pointing to You this Christmas.We know one day every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that You are Lord. And we also know that peace on earth can only come when hearts find peace with You.You are still our Joy and our Peace. You are no longer a babe in the manger, but You are Lord of lords and King of kings. And we still celebrate You as Lord—this Christmas and always.Jesus, You are worthy of our praise! King of kings and Lord of lords, we celebrate You this Christmas.Day-votedly Yours, Rebecca"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men! " (Luke 2: 14, KJV) ."Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people" (Luke 2: 10, NIV) .This post first appeared on Crosswalk.My dear poet friends.

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claimBecause it was grassy and wanted wear,Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to wayI doubted if I should ever come back.I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.

Of this worlds theatre in which we stay,My love like the spectator ydly sitsBeholding me that all the pageants play,Disguysing diversly my troubled wits.Sometimes I joy when glad occasion fits,And mask in myrth lyke to a comedy:Soone after when my joy to sorrow flits,I waile and make my woes a tragedy.Yet she, beholding me with constant eye,Delights not in my merth nor rues my smart:But when I laugh she mocks, and when I cryShe laughs and hardens evermore her heart.What then can move her? if nor merth nor mone,She is no woman, but a senceless stone.

We never joy enjoy to that full pointRegret doth wish joy had enjoyèd been,Nor have the strength regret to disappointRecalling not past joy's thought, but its mien.Yet joy was joy when it enjoyèd wasAnd after-enjoyed when as joy recalled,It must have been joy ere its joy did passAnd, recalled, joy still, since its being-past galled.Alas! All this is useless, for joy's inEnjoying, not in thinking of enjoying.Its mere thought-mirroring gainst itself doth sin,By mere reflecting solid life destroying,  Yet the more thought we take to thought to prove  It must not think, doth further from joy move.

Though we need to weep your loss,You dwell in that safe place in our hearts,Where no storm or night or pain can reach you.Your love was like the dawnBrightening over our livesAwakening beneath the darkA further adventure of colour.The sound of your voiceFound for usA new musicThat brightened everything.Whatever you enfolded in your gazeQuickened in the joy of its being;You placed smiles like flowersOn the altar of the heart.Your mind always sparkledWith wonder at things.Though your days here were brief,Your spirit was live, awake, complete.We look towards each other no longerFrom the old distance of our names;Now you dwell inside the rhythm of breath,As close to us as we are to ourselves.Though we cannot see you with outward eyes,We know our soul's gaze is upon your face,Smiling back at us from within everythingTo which we bring our best refinement.Let us not look for you only in memory,Where we would grow lonely without you.You would want us to find you in presence,Beside us when beauty brightens,When kindness glowsAnd music echoes eternal tones.When orchids brighten the earth,Darkest winter has turned to spring;May this dark grief flower with hopeIn every heart that loves you.May you continue to inspire us:To enter each day with a generous heart.To serve the call of courage and loveUntil we see your beautiful face againIn that land where there is no more separation,Where all tears will be wiped from our mind,And where we will never lose you again.

One heavy day I ran away from the grim face of society and the dizzying clamor of the city and directed my weary step to the spacious alley. I pursued the beckoning course of the rivulet and the musical sounds of the birds until I reached a lonely spot where the flowing branches of the trees prevented the sun from the touching the earth. I stood there, and it was entertaining to my soul - my thirsty soul who had seen naught but the mirage of life instead of its sweetness. I was engrossed deeply in thought and my spirits were sailing the firmament when a hour, wearing a sprig of grapevine that covered part of her naked body, and a wreath of poppies about her golden hair, suddenly appeared to me. As she she realized my astonishment, she greeted me saying, 'Fear me not; I am the Nymph of the Jungle.' 'How can beauty like yours be committed to live in this place? Please tell me who your are, and whence you come? ' I asked. She sat gracefully on the green grass and responded, 'I am the symbol of nature! I am the ever virgin your forefathers worshipped, and to my honor they erected shrines and temples at Baalbek and Jbeil.' And I dared say, 'But those temples and shrines were laid waste and the bones of my adoring ancestors became a part of the earth; nothing was left to commemorate their goddess save a pitiful few and the forgotten pages in the book of history.' She replied, 'Some goddesses live in the lives of their worshippers and die in their deaths, while some live an eternal and infinite life. My life is sustained by the world of beauty which you will see where ever you rest your eyes, and this beauty is nature itself; it is the beginning of the shepherds joy among the hills, and a villagers happiness in the fields, and the pleasure of the awe filled tribes between the mountains and the plains. This Beauty promotes the wise into the throne the truth.' Then I said, 'Beauty is a terrible power! ' And she retorted, 'Human beings fear all things, even yourselves. You fear heaven, the source of spiritual peace; you fear nature, the haven of rest and tranquility; you fear the God of goodness and accuse him of anger, while he is full of love and mercy.' After a deep silence, mingled with sweet dreams, I asked, 'Speak to me of that beauty which the people interpret and define, each one according to his own conception; I have seen her honored and worshipped in different ways and manners.' She answered, 'Beauty is that which attracts your soul, and that which loves to give and not to receive. When you meet Beauty, you feel that the hands deep within your inner self are stretched forth to bring her into the domain of your heart. It is the magnificence combined of sorrow and joy; it is the Unseen which you see, and the Vague which you understand, and the Mute which you hear - it is the Holy of Holies that begins in yourself and ends vastly beyond your earthly imagination.' Then the Nymph of the Jungle approached me and laid her scented hands upon my eyes. And as she withdrew, I found me alone in the valley. When I returned to the city, whose turbulence no longer vexed me, I repeated her words: 'Beauty is that which attracts your soul, and that which loves to give and not to receive.'
